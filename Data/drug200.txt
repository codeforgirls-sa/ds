About the dataset

The data is about a list of patients with a list of diseases. Through the model, we will predict which drug should be provided to the patient.

Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.

Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.

It is a sample of binary classifier, and you can use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to prescribe it to a new patient.

The data fields are: 

Age ==>(Number)
Sex  ==> M or F 
BP  ==> Blood pressure: HIGH, NORMAL, or LOW 
Cholesterol ==>  Blood cholesterol: NORMAL or HIGH 
Na_to_K ==> Blood sodium concentration to Blood potassium concentration 
Drug ==>  Prescription drug to which a patient responded
